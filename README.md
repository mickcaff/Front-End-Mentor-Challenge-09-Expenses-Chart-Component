## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the day with the highest expenses highlighted in a different colour from the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt a lot about JS and manipulating the DOM with this exercise. I chose to create a bar chart using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, without any NPM packages.

My main learnings in regards to JS were:
- Accessing JSON data from a local file using async/await & fetch.
- Clean code principles like Single Responsibility Principle (however I have a lot more to learn in this area).

I chose to dynamically update the bar height based on the percentage relative to the day with the highest expenses for the past 7 days. This was a simple way to show how the past 7 days compare with each other. A more sophisticated graph may choose to display y-axis values and have more defined y-axis scales. 


### Continued development

I really enjoyed this challenge, as I hadn't fully realised the possibilities of creating bar charts with vanilla JS and CSS. 

I would like to repeat this feature on another project accessing an API, possibly financial data or an environmental metric like wave height.
